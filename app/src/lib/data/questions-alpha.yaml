    explicit_text: "What is the Catholic Church's teaching on the Holy Trinity?"
    implicit_text: "What is the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in Christian theology?"
    reference_answer: |
      The Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith. There is one God who exists in three
      divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three Persons are distinct
      from one another but share one divine nature, essence, and substance. They are co-equal and
      co-eternal.

      final judgment, and the eternal states of either Heaven (communion with God) or Hell
      (eternal separation from God).

      The Immaculate Conception is the dogma that the Virgin Mary, from the first moment of her
      conception, was preserved free from all stain of original sin by a singular grace and
      privilege from God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ. This does not refer to Jesus'
      conception, but to Mary's own conception.

      of her life, Mary was taken up to Heaven, both body and soul, without experiencing
      bodily corruption.

    reference_answer: |
      The deposit of faith is the entirety of divine revelation entrusted to the Church by
      Christ and the Apostles. It is composed of Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, which
      together form one sacred deposit of the Word of God. The Magisterium (teaching authority
      of the Church) authentically interprets this deposit.

    reference_answer: |
      The Paschal Mystery is the work of salvation accomplished by Jesus Christ, referring
      mainly to his Passion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension. It is called 'paschal'
      because it fulfills the Passover (Pasch) and inaugurates the new and eternal Passover.
      Through these saving events, Christ redeemed humanity from sin and death.

      God, consubstantial (of the same substance) with the Father and the Son. The Spirit is
      the 'Lord and Giver of Life' who proceeds from the Father and the Son, and who
      sanctifies the Church and her members.

      The Incarnation is the mystery of the Word made flesh. Jesus Christ is true God and true man,
      with two natures (divine and human) united in one divine Person. He was conceived by the Holy
      Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, without ceasing to be God.

      The Resurrection of the Body is the dogma that all the dead will rise at the end of time

    reference_answer: |
      Sanctifying grace is the habitual gift that makes us holy and pleasing to God, dwelling
      in the soul as a permanent disposition. It makes us partakers of the divine nature and
      heirs of eternal life. Actual grace, in contrast, is God's intervention and support in
      every phase of our lives - temporary divine helps that enlighten the mind and strengthen
      the will to do good and avoid evil. Sanctifying grace is our state of friendship with God;
      actual grace is God's help to achieve and maintain it.

      Original sin is the sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve, who disobeyed God's command
      in the Garden of Eden. Through their disobedience, they lost original holiness and justice
      not only for themselves but for all humanity. As a consequence, human nature is wounded:
      inclined to sin, and subject to ignorance, suffering, and death. All humans are born with
      original sin (except Jesus and Mary), which is washed away through Baptism.

      The Church is the Body of Christ means that Christ is the Head and believers are members

      Transubstantiation is the precise term for the change that occurs at consecration during
      Mass. It means the entire substance (the underlying reality) of bread and wine is changed
      into the substance of Christ's Body and Blood, while the accidents (the physical properties
      we perceive - appearance, taste, texture) remain unchanged. This uses Aristotelian
      philosophy: substance is what something truly IS, accidents are its observable properties.

    reference_answer: |
      The principal effects of Baptism are: (1) Purification from all sins - both original sin
      and all personal sins; (2) New birth in the Holy Spirit - becoming a child of God, member
      of Christ, and temple of the Holy Spirit; and (3) Reception of an indelible spiritual mark
      (character) that consecrates the person for Christian worship. Baptism makes us members
      of the Church.

      Confirmation increases baptismal grace, unites us more firmly to Christ, strengthens our
      bond with the Church, and gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and
      defend the faith by word and action as true witnesses of Christ. It also imprints an

      Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles
      continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time. It includes three degrees:
      bishop (episcopate), priest (presbyterate), and deacon (diaconate). This sacrament

      The Mass consists of two principal parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the

      gifts, the Eucharistic Prayer (consecration), and Communion. These two parts are so

    reference_answer: |
      Ex opere operato means 'by the very fact of the action being performed.' It expresses the
      Catholic teaching that sacraments confer grace by the power of Christ's saving work, not
      dependent on the personal holiness of the minister or recipient (though the recipient must
      not place an obstacle). The sacrament is efficacious because it is Christ who acts through
      the sacrament. This guarantees that the sacraments truly transmit the grace they signify.

    reference_answer: |
      Sacraments are seven efficacious signs of grace instituted by Christ and entrusted to the
      Church, through which divine life is dispensed to us. They confer grace ex opere operato.
      Sacramentals, in contrast, are sacred signs instituted by the Church (not Christ) that
      prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it. They include blessings,
      prayers, blessed objects (holy water, medals, etc.). Unlike sacraments, sacramentals work
      ex opere operantis (by the prayer of the Church) and do not confer grace automatically.

      For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must be met: (1) Grave Matter - the action must
      involve serious violation of God's law; (2) Full Knowledge - the person must know the action
      is gravely sinful; and (3) Deliberate Consent - the person must freely choose to commit the
      act. When all three are present, the sin is mortal and destroys charity in the heart.

      The three theological virtues are Faith, Hope, and Charity (Love). They are called 'theological'
      because they relate directly to God: Faith believes in God and all He has revealed; Hope trusts

      The four cardinal virtues are Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance. They are called
      'cardinal' (from Latin 'cardo' meaning hinge) because all other moral virtues are grouped
      around them. They help govern moral conduct and order passions according to reason.

      Subsidiarity is the principle that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest,
      or least centralized competent authority. Higher-level organizations should not assume
      tasks that can be performed effectively at a lower level. This principle protects human
      dignity by respecting individual initiative and the proper autonomy of intermediate
      communities (families, associations, local communities). It opposes all forms of
      collectivism and excessive centralization.

      Solidarity is the principle that all people are responsible for each other - we are all
      'really responsible for all.' It flows from our common human dignity and mutual
      interdependence. Solidarity requires the more fortunate to help the less fortunate and
      promotes the equitable distribution of goods. It calls for commitment to the common good
      and recognizes that the goods of creation are meant for everyone.

      Natural law is the moral law written by God in human nature, discoverable by reason alone.
      It expresses the original moral sense that enables people to discern good and evil through

    reference_answer: |
      Human dignity is rooted in the fact that every person is created in the image and likeness
      of God (imago Dei). This dignity is inherent, inalienable, and equal for all people
      regardless of condition, age, ability, or circumstance. Because humans are created by God
      and redeemed by Christ, every person has infinite worth. This dignity demands respect for
      human life from conception to natural death and grounds all human rights.

      According to the Catechism, prayer is 'the raising of one's mind and heart to God' or
      'the requesting of good things from God.' Prayer is a vital and personal relationship
      with the living and true God. It is the living relationship of the children of God
      with their infinitely good Father, with His Son Jesus Christ, and with the Holy Spirit.

      childhood), Sorrowful (events of Christ's passion), Glorious (events of the resurrection
      and glorification), and Luminous (events of Christ's public ministry). Each mystery is
      meditated upon while praying one decade (10 Hail Marys, preceded by the Our Father).

    reference_answer: |
      Meditation is a form of prayer that engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire to
      deepen understanding of the faith and prompt conversion of heart. It uses Scripture,
      sacred texts, or spiritual writings. Contemplative prayer, in contrast, is a simpler form
      of prayer characterized by silent attention to God's presence, wordless communion, and
      loving gaze upon God. It is a gift of grace beyond discursive thought.

    implicit_text: "What is the role of Jesus' mother in the life of believers?"
    reference_answer: |
      Devotion to Mary is based on her unique role in salvation history as the Mother of God
      (Theotokos). Because she is the mother of Jesus Christ, who is God, she is truly the
      Mother of God. Marian devotion is worship of God through veneration (dulia/hyperdulia)
      of Mary, not worship (latria) of Mary herself. Her intercession is powerful because of
      her closeness to her Son, and honoring her honors Christ who chose her.

    explicit_text: "From a Catholic perspective, what is Eucharistic Adoration?"
    implicit_text: "What is the practice of praying before the consecrated host outside of Mass?"
    reference_answer: |
      Eucharistic Adoration is the practice of worshiping Jesus Christ truly present in the
      Blessed Sacrament. Because the consecrated host remains the Body, Blood, Soul, and
      Divinity of Christ even after Mass, the faithful adore Christ by praying in His sacramental
      presence. This may be done when the Eucharist is reserved in the tabernacle or exposed
      in a monstrance for public adoration.
