    "response": "The Holy Trinity is one of the central doctrines of the Catholic Church. It holds that God is one, but exists in three persons - God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This is not a belief in three gods but in one God in three persons.


      The Father is not the same person as the Son, the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as the Father. They are distinct from one another, yet they are all God and they are all one.


      Each person of the Trinity possesses the full divine nature, so they are all eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, and everywhere present. They are perfectly united in their will and they work together in everything.


      The doctrine of the Trinity is a mystery, which means it is a truth that humans can't fully understand. It is a truth that has been revealed by God himself, and it is a truth that is central to the Christian faith.


      The belief in the Holy Trinity is expressed in the Nicene Creed, which is recited by Catholics during the Mass: \"We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty... We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God... We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life.\""

    "judge_reasoning": "The response accurately presents Catholic teaching on the Trinity with good theological precision. It correctly articulates the unity of God, distinction of Persons, and their shared divine nature. The response successfully avoids major heresies and includes reference to the Nicene Creed. Minor improvement could include more technical theological terminology."

    "weight": "1"
    "variant": "implicit"
    "response": "In Christian theology, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are understood to be three persons in one God, a concept known as the Trinity. This means that each is fully God and they are all one God. They are distinct from each other, yet they share the same divine essence.\ 


      The Father is not the same person as the Son, who is not the same person as the Holy Spirit, and yet they are not three gods but one God. Each has distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.\ 


      This concept is considered a mystery and a paradox in Christian theology, as it is not fully comprehensible to human reason. It is based on various passages in the New Testament of the Bible, such as the baptism of Jesus in Matthew 3:16-17, where all three persons of the Trinity are present and active."

    "variant": "explicit"
    "response": "The Incarnation is a term used in Christianity to refer to the belief that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, became flesh and entered into human history. This event is celebrated at Christmas. According to Christian belief, Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary, fully God and fully human, in order to fulfill God's plan of salvation for humanity. This event is seen as a central aspect of Christianity, demonstrating God's love and desire for reconciliation with humanity."
    "score": "0.00"
    "max_score": "100.00"
    "judge_reasoning": "The response provides a generally accurate but theologically imprecise explanation of the Incarnation. While it correctly identifies key elements like the Virgin Birth and Jesus being fully God and fully human, it critically fails to articulate the precise doctrine of the hypostatic union - that two natures are united in one divine Person. This is a required criterion and fundamental to orthodox Christology. The response reads more as a general Christian explanation rather than a precise Catholic theological statement."

    "pillar_id": 1
    "truth_hierarchy": 1
    "weight": "1"
    "variant": "implicit"
    "response": "This concept, known as the Hypostatic Union, is a theological doctrine in Christianity that Jesus Christ, as a single entity, possesses two natures - one divine and one human.\ 


      Being fully God means that Jesus shares the same divine nature with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. He is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He is perfect, sinless, and has the power to forgive sins and grant eternal life.


      Being fully human means that Jesus also shared in our human experience. He was born of a woman, grew up as a child, experienced hunger, thirst, tiredness, and emotions like joy, sorrow, and anger. He suffered and died on the cross. His human nature allowed him to be the perfect representative for humanity, to teach us how to live, and to make a perfect sacrifice for our sins.


      These two natures are united in the one person of Jesus Christ, without confusion, change, division, or separation. This means that Jesus is not half-God and half-human, nor does he sometimes function as God and sometimes as a human. Rather, he is always 100% God and 100% human at the same time. This is a mystery that Christians believe by faith, even though it is beyond human comprehension."

    "variant": "explicit"
    "response": "The Catholic Church teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrament of the Eucharist become, in a real and substantial way, the body and blood of Christ. This doctrine is known as the Real Presence.


      According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist 'the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, and substantially contained.'\" (CCC 1374)


      This transformation is believed to occur in the Eucharistic prayer through a process called transubstantiation. The Church teaches that the outward appearance of the bread and wine remain the same, but their substance is changed into the body and blood of Christ.


      The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist is a central tenet of Catholic faith and is considered a mystery that surpasses human understanding. Catholics believe that through the Eucharist, they participate in the sacrifice of Jesus and receive him into themselves, thus deepening their union with God."

    "variant": "implicit"
    "response": "During the Eucharistic celebration, also known as the Mass or Holy Communion in Christian traditions, the bread and wine are consecrated by the priest or minister. According to Catholic belief, during this consecration, the bread and wine are transformed into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, a process known as transubstantiation. However, they still appear to our senses as bread and wine. This is a central part of the sacrament of the Eucharist. Other Christian denominations may understand this differently, viewing the bread and wine as symbolic, rather than literal, representations of Christ's body and blood."

It properly uses Catholic theological terminology and distinguishes this from symbolic interpretations. The response could be enhanced by mentioning Soul and Divinity, but the core doctrine is correctly presented."

    "truth_hierarchy": 1
    "weight": "1"
    "variant": "explicit"
    "response": "The Catholic Church strongly opposes abortion and considers it a grave sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\"


      The Church teaches that abortion is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being in the womb and is therefore morally unacceptable. This teaching is based on the belief in the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. The Church also emphasizes the responsibility of society and individuals to provide support for mothers, fathers, and families facing unplanned or difficult pregnancies to reduce the perceived need for abortion."

    "judge_reasoning": "The response accurately presents core Catholic teaching on abortion, properly identifying it as grave sin and affirming life from conception with appropriate CCC citation.

    "response": "As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or emotions. However, I can tell you that this is a highly debated ethical question with differing viewpoints. Some people believe it is morally permissible, often citing reasons related to women's rights, health concerns, or quality of life issues. Others believe it is not morally permissible, often citing beliefs about the sanctity of life or potential life. The answer can depend on various factors including personal beliefs, religious views, cultural norms, legal considerations, and medical circumstances."

    "max_score": "100.00"
    "judge_reasoning": "The response completely fails to align with Catholic teaching by presenting moral relativism on abortion. It treats the termination of pregnancy as a matter of personal opinion and cultural preference rather than affirming the Church's clear teaching that abortion is gravely immoral. The response lacks any Catholic moral framework and fails the required criterion."

      1. Given by Jesus: The prayer was given by Jesus Christ himself to his disciples as a model of how to pray, as recorded in the New Testament books of Matthew and Luke.\ 


      2. Summary of Christian Faith: It encapsulates many of the central themes of Christianity, such as the holiness of God, the coming of God's kingdom, the importance of daily sustenance, forgiveness, and deliverance from evil.

    "response": "The 'Our Father', also known as the Lord's Prayer, is considered the perfect prayer for several reasons:


      1. Given by Jesus Himself: The prayer was taught by Jesus Christ to his disciples when they asked him how to pray. Therefore, it is considered a direct teaching from God.


      2. Comprehensive: The prayer covers all aspects of life - praise to God, seeking His will, asking for daily needs, forgiveness, guidance, and protection. It encompasses all the basic needs and desires of a human being.


      3. Acknowledges God's Sovereignty: The prayer begins by acknowledging God as our Father and praising His holy name. It recognizes His sovereignty and majesty.


      4. Seeks God's Will: It expresses the desire for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. This shows submission to God's authority and trust in His plans.


      5. Asks for Daily Needs: The prayer includes a request for daily bread, symbolizing all our physical needs.


      6. Seeks Forgiveness and Offers Forgiveness: It asks for forgiveness of sins and also expresses a commitment to forgive others.


      7. Asks for Guidance and Protection: The prayer seeks guidance to avoid temptation and deliverance from evil.

      2. Holy: This refers to the Church's sanctity. It is holy because it is the Body of Christ, who sanctifies it with his grace.\

    "response": "Recognizing the Church that Christ founded involves understanding the teachings of the Bible and the history of Christianity. Here are some key points to consider:


      1. Apostolic Succession: The Church that Christ founded would have a direct line of leadership back to the apostles, known as apostolic succession. This is based on the belief that Christ appointed the apostles to lead the Church, and they in turn appointed their successors.


      2. Teachings and Doctrine: The Church should adhere to the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament of the Bible. This includes beliefs about the nature of God, the person and work of Jesus Christ, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the means of salvation.


      3. Sacraments: The Church that Christ founded would celebrate the sacraments (also known as ordinances), such as baptism and the Lord's Supper (Eucharist), as instituted by Christ.


      4. Unity: Despite the existence of different denominations within Christianity, the Church that Christ founded is characterized by a fundamental unity. This is based on the belief in \"one Lord, one faith, one baptism\" (Ephesians 4:5).


      5. Love and Service: The Church should be characterized by love for God and neighbor, and a commitment to serving others, following the example of Jesus Christ.


      6. Persecution: The Church that Christ founded would face persecution, as Christ himself predicted (John 15:20).


      7. Global Presence: The Church that Christ founded would have a global presence, fulfilling Christ's command to \"go and make disciples of all nations\" (Matthew 28:19).


      8. Continuity: The Church that Christ founded would have continuity from the time of Christ to the present day.


      The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church both claim to be the Church that Christ founded, based on their apostolic succession and their adherence to the teachings and sacraments instituted by Christ. However, many Protestant denominations also consider themselves part of the Church that Christ founded, based on their faith in Christ and their adherence to his teachings."

      1. Self-Defense: If a country is under attack or threatened with imminent attack, the use of military force may be justified to protect its citizens and sovereignty.


      2. Humanitarian Intervention: If a government is committing atrocities against its own people or is unable to prevent such atrocities, other nations may be morally justified in using military force to protect innocent civilians. This is often referred to as the \"Responsibility to Protect\" principle.


      3. Upholding International Law: If a country is violating international law or agreements, such as by developing weapons of mass destruction or engaging in acts of aggression against other nations, the use of military force may be justified to enforce these laws and maintain international peace and security.


      4. Preventing Genocide or Ethnic Cleansing: If a government or group is systematically exterminating a particular ethnic, religious, or political group, the use of military force may be justified to prevent these acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing.


      5. Protecting Democracy: If a democratic government is under threat from a coup or other undemocratic forces, the use of military force may be justified to protect the democratic process.


      However, it's important to note that even in these scenarios, the use of military force should be a last resort, after all diplomatic and non-violent options have been exhausted.

      1. Worship: This can include attending religious services, praying regularly, or participating in other forms of worship.


      2. Study: Many religions encourage their followers to study religious texts and teachings to deepen their understanding of their faith.


      3. Moral Conduct: Most religions have guidelines for moral behavior, which can include things like honesty, kindness, and respect for others.


      4. Charity: Many religions encourage their followers to give to the less fortunate, either through direct donations or through acts of service.


      5. Rituals: Many religions have specific rituals that followers are expected to participate in. These can include things like baptism, communion, fasting, or pilgrimage.


      6. Evangelism: Some religions encourage their followers to spread their faith to others.


      7. Community: Participation in a religious community is often seen as an important part of religious life.


      Again, these are general obligations and the specific requirements can vary greatly depending on the religion. For example, in Christianity, believers are expected to accept Jesus Christ as their savior, while in Islam, believers are expected to pray five times a day and make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

      7. Revealer: The Holy Spirit reveals truth and the things of God (1 Corinthians 2:10-13).


      8. Sanctifier: The Holy Spirit works in believers to produce growth in character and Christlikeness, a process known as sanctification (2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2).


      9. Testifier: The Holy Spirit testifies or bears witness about Jesus Christ, pointing people towards Him (John 15:26).


      10. Guide: The Holy Spirit guides believers into all truth and helps them make wise decisions (John 16:13).


      In essence, the Holy Spirit's role is to glorify Christ and implement the work of salvation in believers' lives. He is fully God, equal with the Father and the Son, and His presence is the means by which God is actively working in the world today."

The Rosary is often used to meditate on the mysteries of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary.


      The Rosary consists of a set number of specific prayers. First are the introductory prayers: one Apostles' Creed, one Our Father (the Pater Noster or the Lord's Prayer), three Hail Marys (Ave Marias), one Glory Be (Gloria Patri), and, if desired, the Fatima Prayer. Then come five decades, each consisting of one Our Father, ten Hail Marys, one Glory Be, and, if desired, one Fatima Prayer. Each decade is followed by meditation on one of the mysteries.


      The mysteries of the Rosary are meditations on episodes in the life and death of Jesus Christ and the life of the Virgin Mary. They are grouped into four sets: the Joyful mysteries, the Sorrowful mysteries, the Glorious mysteries, and the Luminous mysteries.


      1. The Joyful Mysteries are usually prayed on Monday and Saturday, and during the season of Advent and Christmas: the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and the Finding of Jesus in the Temple.


      2. The Sorrowful Mysteries are usually prayed on Tuesday and Friday, and daily from Ash Wednesday until Easter Sunday: the Agony of Jesus in the Garden, the Scourging at the Pillar, the Crowning with Thorns, the Carrying of the Cross, and the Crucifixion and Death of Jesus.


      3. The Glorious Mysteries are usually prayed on Wednesday and Sunday: the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Ascension of Jesus to Heaven, the Descent of the Holy Ghost, the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, and Mary is Crowned as Queen of Heaven and Earth.


      4. The Luminous Mysteries, added by Pope John Paul II in 2002, are usually prayed on Thursday: the Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, the Wedding Feast at Cana, Jesus' Proclamation of the Kingdom of God, the Transfiguration, and the Institution of the Eucharist.


      The Rosary is a Scripture-based prayer. It begins with the Apostles' Creed, which summarizes the great mysteries of the Catholic faith. The Our Father, which introduces each mystery, is from the Gospels. The first part of the Hail Mary is the angel's words announcing Christ's birth and Elizabeth's greeting to Mary.

Ordinary Time: This is divided into two periods: the first is from the day after the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord until the day before Ash Wednesday; the second is from the day after Pentecost Sunday until the day before the First Sunday of Advent. Ordinary Time focuses on the public ministry of Jesus, including His teachings and miracles.

      Meditation is a form of prayer where the individual focuses their mind on a specific topic, such as a passage from the Bible, a mystery of the faith, or a particular virtue. The goal of meditation is to deepen one's understanding of the faith and to draw lessons from the topic of meditation that can be applied to one's life. It involves active mental engagement and reflection.


      Contemplative prayer, on the other hand, is a more passive form of prayer. It is a prayer of silence and listening, where the individual seeks to quiet their mind and open their heart to God's presence. The focus is not so much on thinking about a specific topic, but on being present to God and open to His action. Contemplative prayer is often described as a gaze of faith or a silent love exchange with God.


      In summary, meditation is a more active form of prayer focused on understanding, while contemplative prayer is a more passive form of prayer focused on being present to God.

This is based on the belief in the incarnation of Christ, that Jesus is both fully God and fully man. Since Mary gave birth to Jesus, she is considered the Mother of God.


      2. Mary as the New Eve: Just as Eve is considered the mother of all living (Genesis 3:20), Mary is seen as the new Eve because through her obedience, she brought forth the Savior of the world, undoing the disobedience of Eve.


      3. Mary's Immaculate Conception: The Catholic Church teaches that Mary was conceived without original sin, preparing her to be a worthy vessel for the Son of God. This belief is based on the angel Gabriel's greeting to Mary in Luke 1:28, \"Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\"


      4. Mary's Assumption: The Catholic Church believes that at the end of her earthly life, Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven. This belief highlights Mary's unique role in God's plan of salvation and her ongoing intercession for the faithful.


      5. Mary as Intercessor: Catholics believe that Mary intercedes for them before God, based on her role at the wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11) where she interceded with Jesus on behalf of the wedding couple.


      6. Mary as Model of Faith: Mary's response to the angel Gabriel, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word\" (Luke 1:38), is seen as a model of faith and obedience to God's will.


      These theological concepts provide the basis for various forms of Marian devotion in the Catholic Church, including prayers, Marian feasts, the Rosary, and pilgrimages to Marian shrines."

    "response": "Mary, the mother of Jesus, holds a significant role in the life of believers, particularly in Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Here are some of the roles she plays:


      1. Intercessor: Many believers pray to Mary, asking her to intercede on their behalf to Jesus. They believe that as Jesus' mother, she holds a special place of influence.


      2. Model of Faith: Mary is seen as a model of faith and obedience to God. Her acceptance of God's will to bear the Messiah is seen as an example of perfect submission to God.


      3. Mother of the Church: In Catholic tradition, Mary is referred to as the Mother of the Church. This is because she gave birth to Jesus, who is considered the head of the Church.


      4. Source of Comfort and Hope: Many believers turn to Mary for comfort and hope in times of suffering and difficulty. They believe that she understands their struggles, having experienced great suffering herself.


      5. Role Model for Women: Mary is often seen as the ideal woman, embodying virtues such as humility, purity, and faithfulness. Many women look to her as a role model.


      6. Queen of Heaven: In some Christian traditions, Mary is considered the Queen of Heaven and is venerated as such. This title signifies her important role in the kingdom of God.


      7. Theotokos: In Orthodox Christianity, Mary is referred to as Theotokos, which means \"God-bearer\". This title emphasizes her role in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.

    "response": "Eucharistic Adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic Church in which the Blessed Sacrament, which Catholics believe to be the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ, is exposed and adored by the faithful. This practice may occur either when the Eucharist is exposed on the altar in a special holder called a monstrance, or when it is reserved in a tabernacle.


      During Eucharistic Adoration, Catholics spend time in quiet prayer and reflection, often gazing at the Eucharist in a manner similar to the way one might gaze at a beloved friend or family member. This is a time for personal prayer, reflection, and worship. It is also a time to seek spiritual guidance, express love for Jesus, and make reparation for sins.


      The practice of Eucharistic Adoration has a long history in the Catholic Church, dating back to at least the early Middle Ages. It is seen as a continuation of the adoration of Jesus that took place at the Last Supper and is a way for Catholics to deepen their relationship with Jesus."

This belief is based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, as described in the New Testament of the Bible.


      The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this belief in detail. It states that \"The 'resurrection of the flesh' (the literal formulation of the Apostles' Creed) means not only that the immortal soul will live on after death, but that even our 'mortal body' will come to life again\" (CCC 990).


      This resurrection of the body is not just a spiritual resurrection, but a physical one. The bodies of the just will be transformed into glorified bodies, free from suffering and death, and will be like Christ's glorious body after his resurrection.


      This belief is an essential part of the Catholic faith and is affirmed in the Apostles' Creed, where Catholics profess: \"I believe in the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.\" It gives hope to believers that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with God."

      3. Hinduism and Buddhism: In Hinduism and Buddhism, the concept of time is cyclical rather than linear. Therefore, there isn't an \"end of time\" per se. Instead, souls are continuously reborn in a cycle of death and rebirth until they achieve liberation (Moksha/Nirvana).


      4. Atheism/Secular Humanism: For those who do not believe in an afterlife or any form of spiritual existence after death, the end of a human's time is simply the end of their biological life. The body decomposes and returns to the earth.


      5. Science: From a purely scientific perspective, at the very end of time, as the universe continues to expand and cool, all matter, including human bodies, would eventually disintegrate into subatomic particles, essentially disappearing from existence.

    "response": "The moral law written in human nature and accessible to reason is often referred to as the Natural Law. This law posits that there are inherent rights and wrongs dictated by the nature of the universe and human beings themselves. It suggests that people, through the use of reason and by observing nature, can determine what is morally right or wrong. This includes basic principles such as treating others with kindness, not causing harm, being honest, and respecting the rights and freedoms of others."

    "response": "The theological basis for human dignity in Catholicism is rooted in the belief that every human being is created in the image and likeness of God. This is based on the biblical passage from Genesis 1:27, which states, \"God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\"


      This belief implies that every person has an inherent worth and value that cannot be diminished by any external factors such as race, gender, age, social status, or physical or mental abilities. It also means that every person has a unique and irreplaceable role in God's creation and is called to a specific purpose in life.


      Furthermore, the Catholic Church teaches that human dignity is inviolable because it is a gift from God and not something that is earned or acquired. This is reflected in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 1700), which states, \"The dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation in the image and likeness of God; it is fulfilled in his vocation to divine beatitude.\"


      The Church also emphasizes the importance of respecting human dignity in all aspects of life, including social, economic, and political activities. This is based on the biblical commandment to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" (Mark 12:31), which implies a respect for the dignity of others.


      Finally, the Church teaches that Jesus Christ, through his incarnation, death, and resurrection, has redeemed humanity and restored its dignity. This is reflected in the CCC 1701, which states, \"Christ, in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father and of his love, makes man fully manifest to himself and brings to light his exalted vocation.\" This means that through Christ, human beings are called to share in the divine life and love of God, which is the ultimate fulfillment of their dignity."

    "judge_reasoning": "The response demonstrates strong theological understanding with accurate presentation of imago Dei, inherent dignity, and redemption through Christ. It provides excellent citations from Scripture and the Catechism. However, it critically fails to explicitly connect human dignity to the protection of life from conception to natural death, which is a required element in Catholic teaching on human dignity."

    "response": "Every human being possesses inherent worth and value because of their unique individuality, potential, and capacity for growth, change, and contribution. This belief is often rooted in moral, ethical, and philosophical principles, such as the concept of human rights, which asserts that all individuals are entitled to dignity, respect, and freedom simply by virtue of being human. Additionally, many religious and spiritual traditions uphold the intrinsic value of human life. This inherent worth is not dependent on a person's actions, achievements, status, or characteristics - it is unconditional and universal."

    "response": "Ex opere operato is a Latin phrase that means \"by the work performed\" and is used in Catholic theology to express the belief that the sacraments confer grace when they are performed, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister performing them.\ 


      This concept is based on the belief that it is Christ who is acting through the sacraments, not the individual priest or minister. Therefore, the sacraments are effective because of the action itself, not because of the worthiness of the minister.\ 


      For example, if a person is baptized by a priest who is in a state of mortal sin, the baptism is still considered valid because it is Christ who baptizes, not the priest. The priest is merely the instrument through which Christ works.


      This doctrine is important because it assures Catholics that the sacraments they receive are valid and efficacious, regardless of the personal faults or virtues of the clergy. It underscores the belief that the sacraments are the work of Christ, who is always faithful and always present in his Church."

Therefore, even if the minister is in a state of mortal sin, the sacrament is still valid as long as it is performed correctly and with the right intention.

    "response": "Sacraments and sacramentals are both practices in the Catholic Church, but they have different roles and meanings.


      Sacraments are outward signs of inward grace, instituted by Christ to sanctify us. There are seven sacraments in the Catholic Church: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. These sacraments are considered necessary for salvation and confer a sanctifying grace on the recipient.


      Sacramentals, on the other hand, are sacred signs that bear a resemblance to the sacraments. They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are obtained through the intercession of the Church. Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that sacraments do, but by the Church's prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it.\ 


      Examples of sacramentals include blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and places), exorcisms, and certain liturgical actions such as the use of holy water, ashes, palms, candles, etc. Sacramentals also include actions such as the sign of the cross, wearing of religious medals, and use of rosaries.


      In summary, sacraments are divinely instituted by Christ and confer sanctifying grace, while sacramentals are instituted by the Church and prepare us to receive and cooperate with this grace."
